## Overview

ApproveIT helps you quickly review large collections of images and sort them into "approved" and "disapproved" categories. This tool is perfect for:
- Cleaning up photo collections
- Organizing design assets
- Reviewing generated images from AI tools
- Managing large batches of photos

## Features

- **Modern UI**: A professional and clean interface with customizable themes.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes with a single click.
- **Colored Action Buttons**: Green approve and red disapprove buttons for clear visual feedback.
- **Icon-Based Buttons**: Intuitive icons for all major actions.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Navigate and sort images without touching the mouse.
- **Zoom Controls**: Built-in zoom functionality for detailed image inspection.
- **Undo Capability**: Easily undo your last action.
- **Progress Bar**: A visual indicator to track your sorting progress.
- **Non-destructive**: Original images are moved to separate folders, preserving your source directory.

## Pain Points Addressed

### 1. Slow Image Review Process
Traditional image management requires opening each image individually in a viewer, making decisions, and then manually moving files. ApproveIT streamlines this by presenting one image at a time with quick action buttons.

### 2. UI Becomes Unusable During Zoom Operations
Fixed in v1.0: Earlier versions had issues with the UI expanding during zoom operations. This has been resolved with a proper canvas implementation that maintains UI stability.

### 3. Unpredictable Zoom Behavior
Fixed in v1.0: The zoom functionality now properly scales images without affecting the canvas size or button visibility.

### 4. Losing Track of Progress
The application now shows clear progress indicators, including how many images remain to be processed.

### 5. No Way to Undo Actions
Added undo functionality that allows you to reverse up to 10 recent actions.
